<div class="blockquot">
<p>The poems in this volume have been written at various periods of a
busy life, and are widely separated in date of composition. Most of
the minor poems have appeared in Canadian periodicals, and some of
them have the local colour of the city in which they were written. The
poem most recent in date is <i>Marguerite</i>, which has been written under
conditions more favourable than the rest, and which appears now for the
first time. The poems have been inspired by the history and the scenery
of Canada, and in collecting them, and in issuing and publishing them,
the author hopes to put in permanent literary form some of the natural
and social aspects which are peculiar to this country.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>PREFATORY NOTE.</b></p>

<p>The story narrated in the following poem is one of the most touching
of the many romantic legends of the early history of Canada. Some
foundation in fact it undoubtedly has, for it forms the basis of one
of the stories in the collection of Queen Margaret of Navarre, written
while the chief actors in the tragedy were alive. The version of Queen
Margaret differs from that of Thevet in many respects. He gives for his
authorities Roberval and the unfortunate Marguerite herself.</p>

<p>Parkman, in the first volume of his admirable series of histories—the
Pioneers of New France—gives the story as related by Thevet. The
subject readily lends itself to poetical treatment, and, if the
heroine in the poem is made to put a more favourable construction upon
her conduct than the chronicler, it is surely no more than, as the
narrator of her own story, she might have a right to do. The harsh and
tyrannical character of Roberval is drawn in dark lines by Parkman. His
cruelties, in the short lived colony at Cap Rouge, were such than even
the Indians were moved to pity for his victims. On his return to France
he was assassinated at night in the streets of Paris, probably by the
hand of one who had suffered from his tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
In these prosaic days of ocean steamers, cable telegraphs and
light-houses, it is difficult to realize the mystery which, in old
days, enshrouded the shores of the Western continent. The imaginations
of the daring sailors who in their little vessels explored the stormy
seas of the West, teemed with stories of dangers, spiritual as well
as physical. In those days of supernaturalism, Satan might well stand
guard over the great world, where, until then, he had held undivided
sway. This Isle of Demons was one of his outposts. On Wytfliet’s Map
(1597), <i>I. de las Demonios</i> is laid down to the North of Newfoundland,
but too far out of Roberval’s course to be the island of our story. It
is necessary to the narrative that the island in question should be in
the regular route of vessels, and, as the earliest course of sailors to
the Gulf of St. Lawrence was by the straits of Belle Isle, some of the
islands which shelter the harbours of Labrador would probably have been
the scene of the events narrated. Jean Alphonse of Saintonge, who was
Roberval’s first pilot, no doubt indicates the island of our heroine’s
trials under the name of <i>Isles de la Demoiselle</i> in latitude 50° 45′,
and he says there is a good harbour there. This name clung for a long
time to the locality and is found on many old maps. To-day the most
important of the group is known as Grand Meccatina Island.</p>

Quebec was a disastrous failure. It is said that the King, in great
need of Roberval, sent Cartier to bring him home. It is said, too,
that, in after years, the Viceroy essayed to repossess himself of his
transatlantic domain, and lost his life in the attempt. Thevet, on

<div class="footnotes">
<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The origin of
this lyric may possibly be of interest. A young friend had lost an only
sister and, in an outburst of passionate sorrow, had exclaimed “O God
if I could hear her speak.” Brooding over his sorrow, I retired to rest
one evening and without attempting to embody my sympathy in words, I
fell into a quiet slumber which lasted until day light. On waking, I
had a vivid recollection of having seen in dream the youth kneeling by
his sister’s grave and of having heard the words of his sister’s spirit
chanted from the empyrean with inexpressible sweetness as if responding
to his yearning exclamation. The words I heard in my dream I wrote down
immediately lest their exactness and coherency might be lost. I was not
at that time aware that Kubla Khan originated in a somewhat similar
manner. As the occurrence, if standing alone, might seem difficult to
believe, I refer to Coleridge’s poem merely to justify in some degree
the publication of such a freak of the imagination.</p></div>

Parkman, in his <i>Pioneers of France in the New World</i>, says, in
a footnote (p. 321): “According to Lafitau, both bucklers and
breast-plates were in frequent use among the Iroquois. The former were
very large, and made of cedar wood covered with interwoven thongs of
hide.”</p></div>

In this ballad, the writer has purposely omitted to recognize the
part taken in the affair by the few Algonquin and Huron Indians who
joined the Frenchmen. First, because nearly the whole number deserted
to the enemy during the conflict, thus more than counterbalancing
any service which they may have rendered at the outset, and, second,
because the contrast of race and character is lost by mixing civilized
and savage men together as allies in opposition to combatants of the
latter type. For these reasons, he ventures to think that the spirit of
poesy will justify this deviation from the strict line of historical
narration.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
